# bike_share_cyclistic
A data analysis case study about a bike-share company. I made this repository to collect all the SQL queries I wrote in the BigQuery project in order to combine, transform, clean, and finally analyze the full-year dataset in order to identify trends and relationships in how company customers use bikes differently.
