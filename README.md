# Bike-Share Cyclistic Repository
In this case study, I used historical trip data of a bike-share company to identify trends and relationships in data in order to know how casual and member customers differ in usage. I was then able to develop some recommendations for new marketing strategy approaches based on my findings.      
I made this repository to collect all the SQL queries I wrote in the **BigQuery** project in order to *combine*, *transform*, *clean*, and finally *analyze* the full-year dataset.      
Please refer to my [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tariqosama/cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-project) for more details about the analysis steps I took and [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tarek.osama/viz/CyclisticBike-ShareCompany/Dashboard1) for an Extensive Summary.
