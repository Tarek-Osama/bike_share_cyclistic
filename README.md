# Bike-Share Cyclistic Repository
A data analysis case study about a bike-share company. I made this repository to collect all the SQL queries I wrote in the **BigQuery** project in order to *combine*, *transform*, *clean*, and finally *analyze* the full-year dataset in order to identify trends and relationships in how company customers use bikes differently.       

In this case study, I used historical trip data of a bike-share company to identify trends and relationships in data in order to know how casual and member customers differ in usage. I was then able to develop some recommendations for new marketing strategy approaches based on my findings.
