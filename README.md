# Bike-Share Cyclistic Repository
A data analysis case study about a bike-share company. I made this repository to collect all the SQL queries I wrote in the **BigQuery** project in order to *combine*, *transform*, *clean*, and finally *analyze* the full-year dataset in order to identify trends and relationships in how company customers use bikes differently.       

Please refer to my [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tariqosama/cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-project) for more details about the analysis steps I made and [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tarek.osama/viz/CyclisticBike-ShareCompany/Dashboard1) for an Extensive Summary.
In this case study, I perform analysis on historical data from a bike-share company to spot patterns and relationships in the many ways that their users use bikes. I use Tableau, SQL, and spreadsheets as my analysis tools. In this notebook, I provide a detailed analysis of the case study.
