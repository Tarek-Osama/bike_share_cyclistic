The ability to implement that concept was greatly aided by the price plans' flexibility: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Casual riders are those who buy one-ride or all-day passes from the company. Cyclistic members are customers who purchase annual memberships. Increasing the number of annual members will be crucial to Cyclistic's future growth, the marketing director believes, even though the pricing flexibility helps the company gain more clients. There is a great possibility to turn casual riders into members rather than developing a marketing strategy that targets only new clients. In a nutshell, annual members generate far more profit than casual riders.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*****","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Business Task\nTo create marketing plans that will persuade casual riders to become annual members.

After that, I uploaded all 12 .CSV months files (a version without `ride_length` column but cleaned) to my `Google Drive` as they are too large to directly upload them to BigQuery workspace.

So, I looked deep into Docked data. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## A closer look into docked bike data.   \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/72qKnQ3/11.png)     \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/bXBgQ8j/11-tab.png)      \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Z8Xt4NG/Docked-Viz.png)   \n\n\nCasuals tend to ride docked bikes more in the **Summer season** and less in the **Winter season**. Casuals usually make many rides on Saturdays and Sundays (weekends), as expected. As we get closer to the weekends average trip duration goes up until it reaches its peak on Sundays.\nPeak hours throughout the day are between **12pm** and **18pm**. Lowest trip counts and highest average trip duration are after midnight.       \n\nStart stations and End stations data shows some really usefull insights about some places Casuals and Members most often use Cyclistic Bikes to go to.      \n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What are the most common start and end stations for both users? and are there any similarities?\nSince there are **5824 bicycles** that are geotracked and locked into a network of **692 stations** across Chicago, then analyzing stations data would help us know what are the most visited stations by both user types and given the location of these stations and their surroundings we could understand the reason behiend the visit and their intentions. Maybe they ride bikes for leisure or use them to commute to work each day. Let's see.       \n\nWe will start with start stations.     \n\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/9Yf2vPd/12start.png)      \n\n**Top10 Start Stations for Casual Riders:**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QQGcjxK/12start-tab.png)       \n\n**Top10 Start Stations for Member Riders:**   \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/C16Pp7D/12start-tab-2.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/2nPjRNd/Top10-start-stations.png)     \n\n\nAn interesting observation here is that out of top 10 start stations for both casuals and members *only one station in common between the two top 10 lists*, which is **Wells St & Concord Ln**, listed *8th* for casuals and *3rd* for members.     \nMost common **casuals** start station is **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave** which is listed *11th* in members list. Meanwhile, Most common **members** start station is **Kingsbury St & Kinzie St** which is listed *43rd* in casuals list.     \n\nAfter doing a quick research online about the listed start stations in both lists, I found that most of the listed casual start stations are close to lake or some famous tourist monuments and sites like **DuSable Lake Shore Dr & Monroe St**, **Millennium Park**, **Theater on the Lake**, and **Shedd Aquarium**.     \nMeanwhile, members top start stations include some stations close to places like downtowns and retail markets like **Kingsbury St & Kinzie St**.     \n\n> **The way I see it, is that casual people category may include tourists coming to spend weekends in the statue of chicago so their main destinations would be tourist monuments or it could include locals and they are spending weekends out on bikes offered by a bike-share company for leisure and that hypothesis is back up by the fact that casuals tend to make more trips on Weekends.   \n> On the other hand, member people category could include locals who use cyclistic bikes to commute to work each day or shopping trips since members de make more trips on Midweeks.**\n>    \n\nNow, let's apply the same analysis to end stations data.     \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/G5LjtMm/12end.png)      \n\n**Top 10 End Stations for Casual Riders:**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/WkTkt82/12end-tab.png)       \n\n**Top 10 End Stations for Member Riders:**    \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/3rFmQ4f/12end-tab-2.png)      \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8bCrZ4m/Top10-end-stations.png)      \n\n\nThe two lists *only have one common end station* which is also the same common start station between them **Wells St & Concord Ln** , listed also *8th* for casuals and *3rd* for members.    \nMost common **casuals** end station is also **Streeter Dr & Grand Ave** which is listed *20th* in members list. Meanwhile, Most common **members** end station is **Kingsbury St & Kinzie St** which is listed *51st* in casuals list.       \n\n> **An interesting pattern is that both the top 10 start stations list and top 10 end stations list for casuals have 9 stations in common and most of them maintain the same ranking. Moreover, members both lists have all stations in common and most of them maintain the same ranking.**         \n\n\nGiven the fact stated above, What are the chances for a rider to start a trip at a station and end it at the same station? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##  13.

However, throughout the whole year Member riders outnumbered Casual riders.    \n\n* **Weekends for Casuals, Midweeks For Members**; as we saw earlier Weekends are greatly preferred by casual riders, and the variance in their trip duration throughout the week is greater. Members like the middle of the week a little bit, and they bike for very similar amounts of time every day.     \n\n* **Casual riders mainly use bikes for leisure**, visiting city monuments. Members utilize more stations overall and for a wider variety of reasons.       \n\n* In terms of time and peak hours, both types peak hours in evening. Morning hours are different, Members use bikes more than Casuals and that gap in usage could be a \"**Morning Chance**\" to attract more Casuals.   \n\nThere are three areas we should take into account for recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members. These areas are :     \n> * **Seasonality.**       \n> * **Trip Purpose.**        \n> * **Morning Gap.**\n> \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*************","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Recommendations       \n## Seasonality      \nCasual riders make more trips in Summer Season and that is a good chance to make some several specials and promos during the Season campaign throughout the course of Summer targeting Casual riders to subscribe into an annual memberships. Also, these memberships could include discount offers to encourage Casual riders to become annual members.     \n\n\n## Trip Purpose     \nCasual Riders mainly ride bikes for leisure and enterainment on Weekends, lengthening of rides and increased activity on weekends.     \nConsider creating an annual package tailored for Casual rider intentions, adding some features and offers for using bikes in Weekends, visiting city monuments or any Weekend activities.       \n\n\n## Morning Gap      \nBoth groups make similar numbers of trips throughout the day, with evening commute times seeing the greatest number of trips. The only time period, from **4 AM** to **10 AM**, that is when the **Morning Gap** occurs, is during the morning commute.        \nIn order to fill that gap with more users we need first to promote the advantages of using the Cyclistic bike-share system for morning and evening trips and to show users how easy and comfortable it is to ride bikes to work commutes in the morning.  \n\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
