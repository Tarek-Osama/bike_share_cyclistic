# About Data  

This is public data that can be used to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. The datasets are downloaded from this [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The data has a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. Data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).  

Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data for the year **2022** to be analyzed in order to identify trends and relationships. By analyzing trip data, in-depth insights about how casual and annual members differ in bike usage over the year of 2022 could be captured.

I will be using mainly **BigQuery** to analyze data for the whole 12 months after downloading it from the link above and performing some initial data cleaning and transforming in **MS Excel** then uploading files to **BigQuery**.
